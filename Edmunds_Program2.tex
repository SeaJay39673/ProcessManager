\section*{Statement of Help}
\subsection*{Kyler Legault}
Kyler has helped me quite a bit with this project. He mostly warned me about bugs he came across, as well as rubber ducky-ed for me
when I came across bugs. Most importantly, he showed me the following stack overflow link to help me get started with reading input from the pipes.

\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22189637/creating-or-passing-a-string-from-a-pipe}.

We also discussed quite heavily different ways we could implement our code, and talked at a higher level of how we were implementing our own code. 

\subsection*{Howard Shaw}
I helped Howard with getting his pipes set up (showed him the same link Kyler showed me).
I also explained how the program is supposed to work and helped talk him through his code for the first few commands.

\subsection*{Isaiah}
So far, I helped him set up his pipes (also showed him the same link).
